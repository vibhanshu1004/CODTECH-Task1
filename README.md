PROJECT DETAILS: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The project uses three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest—to identify anomalies and predict fraudulent transactions based on historical data.

Project Overview:-
Credit card fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning in finance, helping to prevent financial losses and enhance transaction security. This project demonstrates the use of ML algorithms on a dataset of credit card transactions to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent activities.

Dataset:-
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

Models Used:-
Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective linear model for binary classification.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric algorithm that classifies a point based on its neighbors.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees for classification.

Installation:-
1. Clone the repository:
git clone [](https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git)
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
2. Install dependencies:
[](pip install -r requirements.txt)
3. Download the dataset and place it in directory.
