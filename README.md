## Project Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning in finance, helping to prevent financial losses and enhance transaction security. This project demonstrates the use of ML algorithms on a dataset of credit card transactions to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent activities.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset includes transactions that occurred over two days, where there are 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

## Models Used
1. **Logistic Regression:** A simple yet effective linear model for binary classification.  
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A non-parametric algorithm that classifies a point based on its neighbors.  
3. **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees for classification.
